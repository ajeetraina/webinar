00:44:50	Mahendra Lalani:	how can i used redfish API in my project
00:47:53	Ajeet Raina:	Mahendra, you can use it for any hardware which support Redfish 
Redfish is supported on Dell starting 12G+
It works on all latest HW which support Redfish 
You can check if Redfish is supported or not using iDRAC or HPE iLO

00:48:55	balasundaram:	 Mahendra pl look at this
00:49:41	Mahendra Lalani:	thank you sir it's really very helpful
00:51:00	Ajeet Raina:	Think of Packets.net which host Dell, HPE or Supermicro server. You can use Redfish API to reboot, config changes  etc. sitting on your laptop
00:51:36	Ajeet Raina:	Redfish API is powerful enough to control and config the remote HW without any great effort
